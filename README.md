# AirlineReservationSystem-
For this homework, you will simulate a simple Airline Reservation System which will involve accessing shared resources. In real life, there are travel agencies who try to reserve seats for their customers. When a customer asks for a seat from a speciﬁc ﬂight, the agency checks if there is an empty seat in the aircraft and reserves it immediately (if there is any). A customer can reserve more than one seat if needed. Since there are a lot of travel agencies out there, the reservations will be done based on FCFS (ﬁrst come, ﬁrst served) strategy. Only one reservations can be made on a seat, so there will be no overbooking. There will be one thread per agency simulating the activities of that agency. When an agency thread is booking a seat, the rest will do busy waiting.  For implement the following use POSIX threads
